#  CordovaWebApp


## Getting started
- Make sure you have the following installed:
    - [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo): `npm install -g yo`
    - [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt): `npm install -g grunt-cli`
    - [cordova-cli](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli): `npm install -g cordova`

- Install any SDKs you need for developing platform applications:
    - [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
    - [Android](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#ExistingIDE)
    - etc...

- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-cordova`

- Get bower and nodejs dependencies inside `yeoman` folder

## Usage

### Serve to emulator
`grunt emulate`: builds and emulates all installed platforms

`grunt live-emulate`: builds and emulates all installed platforms, watching for changes then building/redeploying the emulator.

### Serve to device
`grunt device`: builds and runs all installed platforms

`grunt live-device`: builds and runs all installed platforms, watching for changes then building/redeploying.


### Options
`--platform`: sets a platform to build/emulate. eg. `--platform=ios`

`--family`: sets a family to build/emulate. eg. `--family=ipad`

#### Example
`grunt live-emulate --platform=ios --family=ipad`: builds and emulates the `ios` platform using the `ipad` family.

## Experimental webapp Integration
Inside `yeoman` folder.
- You'll get the following:
	- Live Reload with auto prepare with `grunt server`
	- Autoprefixer, which will automatically add vendor prefixes (i.e. display: flex will give you all vendor versions, old and new)
	- Sass supprt, CSS, JS, HTML minification

- Your commands are:
	- `grunt run` to run on a device
	- `grunt emulate` to run on an emulator
	- `grunt build` to build the web and cordova project
	- `grunt server` to start a local server (with live reload)
- Options
	- This only supports the use of `--platform=ios` at the moment
